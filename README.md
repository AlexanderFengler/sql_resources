Beginners course covering PostGreSQL and related setup

[Stanford Course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about) 

Beginner course however a lot more theoretical. 
This is a proper college course offerece self-paced in 2-4 week chunks (mini-courses).

[Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science#courses)

Somewhere inbetween the former two courses. Culminates in final project, has focus on practical usage, however is a whole specialization hence likely broadest coverage.
